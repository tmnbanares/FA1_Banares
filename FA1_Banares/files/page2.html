	<h1>New Year Celebration</h1>
		<h3>New Year's Eve and New Year</h3>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li> I like the feeling of a new beginning.</li>
			<li>The New Year's resolutions that we share with our families and the thrill that we feel every countdown are always memorable.</li>
			<li>I kind of don't like the noises from the firecrackers because its too loud for me.</li>
			<li> However, I adore seeing the night sky be lit up by a lot of bright and colorful fire works and sparklers.</li>
