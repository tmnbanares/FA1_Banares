	<h1>All Souls Day</h1>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li>This is one of my favorites because I get to remember the lives of my loved ones that passed. </li>
			<li>Through the stories my family tells about them, I also get to know more about their life.</li>
			<li>I get to visit their graves, buy them flowers, light candles, talk about anything, and reminisce about the moments that we had together.</li>
