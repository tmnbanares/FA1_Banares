		<h3>Christmas Eve and Christmas Day</h3>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li>I enjoy the planning we do and the excitement that we feel every Christmas Eve.</li>
			<li>The best parts of Christmas are the dishes, which taste even better every Christmas season, the bright, flashy decorations, the carolers, and the gifts we get from our loved ones.</li>
			<li>The nicest feeling ever is having to take a break from school so that you can spend more time with your family and friends.</li>
			<li>The feeling of gratitude that comes from being reminded of Jesus' birth, and the after-church gathering is always enjoyable and it will always be. </li>
